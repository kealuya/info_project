# Info_Project: Business Marketing System

Info_Project is a business marketing system where enterprise managers can assign tasks that are executed by sales representatives. The representatives complete the tasks, upload the task materials, and receive authentication.

## Features

- **WeChat Service Account Page & PC Page**: The system provides both a WeChat service account page and a PC page for user interaction and task management.
  
- **Speech Recognition Integration**: We integrate with iFLYTEK's speech recognition API to convert voice input from the WeChat service account into text. This text can then be processed by large language models to obtain answers to questions.

- **Meeting Management**: Using open-source components, the system can record meetings, transcribe them, and produce summaries. Additionally, it can generate mind maps based on the meeting content.

- **Multiple AI Model Interactions**: The platform supports various interaction methods with multiple AI models. The backend is integrated with Dify, and connects to large language models such as Wenxin Yiyan and Baichuan.
